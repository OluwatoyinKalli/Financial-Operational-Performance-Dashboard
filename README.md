# 📊 Financial & Operational Performance Dashboard

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates the development of an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution using Power BI to transform transactional financial data into actionable business insights. The interactive dashboard enables decision-makers to monitor sales performance, profitability, operational efficiency, and key business metrics across multiple countries, customer segments, and products.

---

## Business Problem

Organizations operating across multiple markets often rely on fragmented reports and spreadsheets, making it difficult to answer critical business questions such as:

- Which products generate the highest profitability?
- Which customer segments drive the most revenue?
- How do discounts affect profit margins?
- What sales trends and seasonal patterns influence performance?
- Where should leadership focus future investments?

Without centralized reporting, decision-making becomes slower and opportunities for growth are easily overlooked.

---

## Solution Overview

To address these challenges, I developed a four-page interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates financial and operational metrics into a single reporting solution.

The dashboard enables users to:

- Monitor organizational KPIs
- Analyze sales performance
- Evaluate profitability
- Identify operational trends
- Support data-driven business decisions

# Financial & Operational Performance Dashboard

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates the ability to take a raw financial dataset and transform it into a production-grade, multi-page Power BI dashboard that directly supports strategic and operational decision-making.
Headline findings:
The business generated $118.73M in total sales and $16.89M in profit (14.23% margin) across 5 countries, 5 customer segments, and 6 products over a 16-month period. Revenue is relatively balanced across geographies, but the Government segment dominates at 44% of revenue. Paseo is the flagship product, leading both revenue and volume. Profitability analysis reveals that while core margins are healthy, discount practices and product mix inefficiencies present clear opportunities for margin improvement estimated in the $2–5M range.

## Project Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution built on a financial dataset. The report transforms transactional sales data into an interactive, multi-page Power BI dashboard that enables stakeholders to monitor performance across sales, profitability, and operations; all filterable by Year, Country, Segment, and Product.

## Business Problem

Organizations operating multi-segment, multi-country sales operations often lack real-time visibility into the metrics that drive strategic decisions. Without a unified analytics solution, leadership teams struggle to answer critical questions such as:

* Revenue & Profitability:  Which markets and customer segments generate the most revenue and the highest profit margins?
* Discount Impact:  Are current discounting strategies helping or hurting overall profitability?
* Product Performance: Which products deliver the strongest margins, and which are underperforming?
* Sales Trends: How are sales and unit volumes trending month-over-month, and what seasonal patterns exist?
* Resource Allocation: Where should leadership prioritize pricing strategy, sales effort, and resource investment?

Finance and operations teams are often left relying on disconnected spreadsheets, delayed reporting cycles, and manual calculations thus, slowing decision-making and obscuring strategic opportunities that could drive growth.
This project addresses that gap by building an interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates financial and operational data into a single, real-time analytical view, enabling data-driven decisions across sales, profitability, and operations.

## Key Insights

### Revenue & Market Performance
* The USA leads revenue at $25.03M, closely followed by Canada ($24.89M) and France ($24.35M). All five markets are within a $4M revenue band, suggesting relatively balanced geographic distribution; but the USA holds a slight competitive edge.
* Government is the largest revenue segment, generating $52.5M; more than Small Business ($42.4M) and nearly 3x Enterprise ($19.6M). Channel Partners ($1.8M) and Midmarket ($2.4M) represent minimal contribution and may warrant strategic review.
* Paseo is the dominant product, it generates the highest total sales (~$28M+) and the highest total units sold (~0.35M), making it the cornerstone of the product portfolio.

### Profitability
* Total profit margin of 14.23% is a healthy baseline for a multi-country, multi-segment operation. However, at $16.89M profit on $118.73M revenue, there is meaningful room for margin expansion through pricing and discount optimization.
* Amarilla has the highest profit margin % among all products, while Carretera and Montana show lower margins despite decent sales volumes, suggesting possible pricing or cost structure inefficiencies in those lines.
* VTT punches above its weight: it generates high profit relative to its sales volume, indicating strong unit economics and pricing power.

### Discount & Cost Analysis
* Discount levels vary significantly by product. The Discount Impact scatter reveals that some products receive heavy discounts (up to $2.5M–$3M in aggregate discounts) without proportionally higher profits, indicating potential over-discounting practices that erode margin.
* Manufacturing cost vs. profit analysis shows Paseo and VTT achieve the most favorable profit-to-manufacturing-cost ratios, while other products show tighter spreads.

### Trends & Seasonality
* Sales trend shows significant seasonality, clear peaks are visible in mid-2014 and November 2014, with troughs in early 2014. This pattern has direct implications for inventory planning, staffing, and cash flow forecasting.
* Units Sold trend mirrors the revenue trend, confirming volume (not just price) is a primary driver of the revenue peaks, particularly relevant for supply chain and demand planning teams.

## Recommendations

* Double Down on Government Segment At $52.5M in revenue, Government is the highest-value segment. Sales and account management resources should prioritize Government contract renewals and expansions. Develop tailored product bundles and competitive pricing frameworks for Government procurement cycles.
* Investigate Midmarket and Channel Partners Underperformance Combined, these two segments generate only $4.2M (3.5% of total revenue). Leadership should evaluate whether to invest in growing these segments or strategically deprioritize them in favour of higher-return channels.
* Optimize Discount Strategy The Discount Impact analysis reveals products receiving heavy discounts that do not generate proportionally higher profits. Implement tiered discount governance, especially for Paseo and Carretera, with approval thresholds tied to deal profitability, not just deal size.
* Protect and Expand Paseo Paseo is the highest-revenue and highest-volume product. Ensure supply chain capacity supports this demand, review its pricing strategy for potential upward adjustment in premium markets (USA, Canada), and explore adjacent product line extensions.
* Investigate Carretera and Montana Margin Gaps These two products show the lowest profit margins. Conduct a cost review to determine whether manufacturing inefficiencies, discount practices, or pricing misalignment is the root cause. Set a margin floor and build a corrective action plan.
* Leverage Seasonality for Planning The November 2014 sales peak should inform Q4 inventory build-up, promotional calendar planning, and sales team capacity. Consider launching targeted campaigns in slow months (Q1) to smooth revenue distribution and reduce over-dependence on year-end peaks.
* Prioritize VTT for Margin Expansion VTT demonstrates strong profit-to-sales efficiency. Evaluate whether VTT can capture additional market share through targeted marketing investment, particularly in France and Germany where revenue levels are strong.
